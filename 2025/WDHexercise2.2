#Exercise 2.2
#In mathematics, an arithmetic sequence is a sequence of real numbers
#u1,u2,⋯,un 
#such that the difference between two consecutive terms is constant, i.e.  un+1−un=d  for some constant  d∈R , called the common difference and  n≥1 .

#For example, the sequence  2,5,8,11,14,…  is an arithmetic sequence with first term  2  and common difference  3 .

#Write a program to generate the first  n  terms of an arithmetic sequence with a user defined first term  a  and common difference  d .

#The problem:
#Request a numeric input from the user to be used as the first term. Let us denote this input as first_term.
#Request a numeric input from the user to be used as the common difference. Let us denote this input as common_difference.
#Request an integer input from the user for the number of terms. Let us denote this input as number_of_terms.
#Print out the sequence up to the  n th term.

first_term = float(input("please key in the first term in the arithmetric sequence:"))
common_difference = float(input("please key in the common difference:"))
number_of_terms = int(input("please key in the number of terms in the arithmetric sequence:"))
for i in range(number_of_terms):
    print(first_term + i * common_difference)
